# MemMeth
## In a Nutshell:
Simulates an intelligent memory management algorithm which dynamically assign and prioritize user essential utilities to active process execution without explicit declaration by the user thus improving the performance and interaction experience. The algorithm was evaluated in user environment with process entering memory blocks at random time.

## Developed with and dependencies:
Python - https://www.python.org/
<br>psutil(psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python) - https://pypi.org/project/psutil/

## Local Execution
Python -m program.py
